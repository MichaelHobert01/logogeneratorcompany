# Project 10

Project 10 is a svg logo generator made using javascript. It took me about 3 hours to figure out how to make it work.

## Usage 

Project 10 requires that you go into the index.js and run node index.js. After doing that it will ask you for information about your logo, once you are done inputting that, a new svg file will appear. Change the end of it to be .html. Then open it in your browser. You will see your new logo!
